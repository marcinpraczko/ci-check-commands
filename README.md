# ci-check-commands

This is very simple project which aims to help detecting commands in system.

Working with containers have more and more configuration that some containers are not having
expected command and new image should be build (based on official build).

This project should be very simple which could be run as initial job to give more accurate information about commands.

I am starting with BASH solution / maybe I will extend this to Python (Easier to generate some output).
